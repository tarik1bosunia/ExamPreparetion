  /*  Constructor of enum type is private. If you don't declare private compiler internally creates private constructor.*/
/*
    * Can we create the instance of Enum by new keyword?
    No, because it contains private constructors only.
    Can we have an abstract method in the Enum?

    Yes, Of course! we can have abstract methods and can provide the implementation of these methods.
