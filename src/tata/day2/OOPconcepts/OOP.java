    Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language.
    The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly
     object-oriented programming language.

    Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.

    The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities,
     for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

     Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc.
     Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using
     classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

    Object
    Class
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism
    Abstraction
    Encapsulation

    Object
Java Object

Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard,
 bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.

An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes
up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each
other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the
 type of response returned by the objects.

Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc.
 as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.

 An object has three characteristics:

    State: represents the data (value) of an object.
    Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
    Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.
     The value of the ID is not visible to the external user.
      However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.



Class

Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
 Class doesn't consume any space.

 Inheritance

When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
Polymorphism in Java
Polymorphism

If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.

In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.
Abstraction

Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
Encapsulation in Java OOPs Concepts
Encapsulation

Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.

A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.


Instance variable in Java

A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable.
 Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object or
 instance is created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.

 new keyword in Java

The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.

3 Ways to initialize object

There are 3 ways to initialize object in Java.

    By reference variable
    By method
    By constructor
